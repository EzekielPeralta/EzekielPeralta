### 🌟 About Me

I am currently a 2nd-year Information Technology student at New Era University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.  
I am also a **Trainee of the Society of Information Technology Students (SITS)** at New Era University, gaining hands-on experience in IT projects and collaborative initiatives.  

I am highly interested in networking, IT infrastructure, and project management, aiming to one day work as a networking specialist or project master managing large-scale IT initiatives.  
I enjoy exploring how systems connect, communicate, and scale, and I am constantly improving my knowledge in networking, hardware/software integration, and organizational leadership in IT environments.
